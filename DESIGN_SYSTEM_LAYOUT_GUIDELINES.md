# UI Layout Consistency: Design System Guidelines

## 1. Introduction

These guidelines provide a comprehensive strategy for establishing and enforcing robust UI layout consistency across all page types and states within our digital product. The goal is to ensure a predictable, cohesive, and intuitive user interface that enhances user experience and streamlines development.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Predictability:** Users should be able to anticipate where information and interactive elements will be located across different sections of the application.
- **Cohesion:** All parts of the application should feel like they belong to a single, unified system.
- **Clarity:** Layouts should prioritize content and functionality, making it easy for users to understand and interact with the interface.
- **Efficiency:** Consistent layouts reduce cognitive load, allowing users to complete tasks more quickly and with fewer errors.
- **Scalability:** Guidelines should be flexible enough to accommodate future growth and new features without breaking consistency.
- **Accessibility:** Layouts must be designed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by adhering to WCAG standards.

## 3. Global Page Architecture

This section defines the standard structure for all pages.

### 3.1. Header

- **Placement:** Fixed at the top of the viewport on desktop; may be fixed or auto-hiding on mobile.
- **Content:**
  - **Logo/Brand Identity:** Consistently placed (e.g., top-left).
  - **Primary Navigation (if applicable):** See section 3.3.
  - **Search Bar (if global):** Consistent placement and behavior.
  - **User Profile/Account Actions:** Typically top-right (e.g., avatar, settings, logout).
  - **Notifications:** Clearly indicated, often near user profile actions.
- **Behavior:**
  - Height should be consistent across all pages.
  - Scroll behavior (e.g., sticky, collapsing) should be uniform.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Inconsistent header height.
  - Varying placement of core elements like logo or user actions.
  - Header content that changes drastically between sections without clear user benefit.

### 3.2. Footer

- **Placement:** Fixed at the bottom of the page content.
- **Content:**
  - Copyright information.
  - Links to privacy policy, terms of service, contact information.
  - Secondary navigation links (e.g., sitemap, FAQ).
  - Social media links (optional, consistently styled).
- **Behavior:**
  - Should not obscure content.
  - Height should be consistent or adapt predictably based on content.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Overloading the footer with too much information.
  - Inconsistent link styling or placement.

### 3.3. Primary Navigation

- **Types:**
  - **Top Navigation:** Integrated into the header, suitable for a limited number of primary sections.
  - **Sidebar Navigation:** Placed on the left (or right, if LTR/RTL considerations dictate) for applications with many sections or hierarchical navigation.
- **Placement & Behavior:**
  - **Top Nav:** Consistent order, clear visual distinction for active/hover states. Dropdowns for sub-navigation should be predictable.
  - **Sidebar Nav:** Can be fixed, collapsible, or overlay on smaller screens. Icons with labels are preferred for clarity. Active state must be prominent.
- **Consistency:** The chosen primary navigation pattern should be used consistently throughout the application. Avoid mixing top and sidebar navigation for primary sections unless there's a very strong contextual reason.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Hidden or difficult-to-discover primary navigation.
  - Inconsistent labeling or iconography.
  - Changing navigation patterns between closely related sections.

### 3.4. Sidebars (Contextual/Secondary)

- **Purpose:** Used for secondary navigation, filters, contextual information, or actions related to the main content area.
- **Placement:** Typically to the right or left of the main content area, distinct from primary navigation sidebars.
- **Behavior:**
  - Can be fixed, scrollable independently of main content, or collapsible.
  - Width should be standardized or follow predefined tiers.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Using contextual sidebars for primary navigation.
  - Inconsistent width or placement that disrupts page flow.

## 4. Grid Systems and Spacing Rules

A consistent grid and spacing system is fundamental to visual harmony and predictability.

### 4.1. Grid System

- **Type:** A flexible column-based grid (e.g., 12-column or 24-column) is recommended.
- **Gutters:** Standardized gutter widths between columns.
- **Margins:** Standardized page margins (left and right).
- **Usage:** All major layout blocks and components should align to the grid.
- **Example (Conceptual):**
  - `Desktop:` 12-column grid, 24px gutter, 32px page margins.
  - `Tablet:` 8-column grid, 16px gutter, 24px page margins.
  - `Mobile:` 4-column grid, 16px gutter, 16px page margins.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Elements placed arbitrarily, not aligning to grid columns.
  - Inconsistent gutter or margin sizes.

### 4.2. Spacing Scale (Margins and Padding)

- **Base Unit:** Define a base spacing unit (e.g., 4px or 8px).
- **Scale:** All margins and padding values should be multiples of this base unit (e.g., 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px).
- **Application:**
  - **Vertical Rhythm:** Consistent vertical spacing between text blocks, headings, and other elements to create a harmonious flow.
  - **Component Spacing:** Standardized internal padding for components (buttons, cards, inputs) and margins between components.
- **Example Scale (8px base):**
  - `xxs:` 4px
  - `xs:` 8px
  - `sm:` 16px
  - `md:` 24px
  - `lg:` 32px
  - `xl:` 48px
  - `xxl:` 64px
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Arbitrary spacing values not adhering to the scale.
  - Inconsistent spacing between similar elements across different pages.
  - Lack of vertical rhythm, leading to a cluttered or disjointed appearance.

## 5. Content Area Patterns

Standardize the layout of common content structures.

### 5.1. Forms

- **Label Placement:** Consistent (e.g., top-aligned, left-aligned). Top-aligned is often preferred for scannability and mobile adaptability.
- **Input Fields:** Standardized width (full-width, fixed-width tiers), height, and spacing between fields.
- **Help Text/Error Messages:** Consistent placement (e.g., below the field) and styling.
- **Action Buttons (Submit, Cancel):** Consistent placement (e.g., bottom-right, full-width at bottom) and order.
- **Grouping:** Use fieldsets or visual dividers for long forms with logical sections.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Mixed label alignments within the same form or across different forms.
  - Inconsistent spacing around form elements.
  - Submit buttons placed unpredictably.

### 5.2. Tables

- **Alignment:** Consistent text alignment within cells (e.g., text left-aligned, numbers right-aligned).
- **Header:** Clearly distinguished from body rows.
- **Row/Cell Padding:** Standardized padding for readability.
- **Actions:** Consistent placement for row-level actions (e.g., edit, delete icons at the end of the row).
- **Density:** Offer options for comfortable vs. compact table views if necessary, but with consistent spacing rules for each.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Inconsistent text alignment.
  - Poor visual distinction between header and data rows.
  - Cluttered cells due to insufficient padding.

### 5.3. Dashboards & Item Listings

- **Card-Based Layouts:** If using cards, ensure consistent card sizing (or a set of predefined sizes), spacing between cards, and internal card structure.
- **List Views:** Consistent row height, spacing, and placement of primary vs. secondary information within each list item.
- **Filters & Sorting Controls:** Consistent placement (e.g., above the list/grid, in a dedicated sidebar).
- **Pagination:** Standardized placement and style.
- **Empty States:** Consistent design for when no data is available.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Irregular card sizes or spacing in a grid.
  - Inconsistent information hierarchy in list items.
  - Filters or sorting controls that move around.

## 6. Common Container Patterns

Standardize the appearance, placement, and behavior of common UI containers.

### 6.1. Modals (Dialogs)

- **Placement:** Centered on the screen, with a backdrop overlay to dim page content.
- **Structure:**
  - **Header:** Title, close button (typically top-right).
  - **Body:** Content area.
  - **Footer:** Action buttons (e.g., Confirm, Cancel), consistently aligned (e.g., right-aligned).
- **Size:** Predefined size tiers (small, medium, large, full-screen on mobile) or content-adaptive with max-width/height.
- **Behavior:**
  - Should trap focus.
  - Dismissible via close button, ESC key, or clicking the overlay (configurable).
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Modals that are too small or too large for their content.
  - Inconsistent placement of action buttons or close icon.
  - Modals that don't trap focus or are hard to dismiss.

### 6.2. Cards

- **Purpose:** Group related information and actions into a digestible unit.
- **Structure:** Consistent internal padding and structure (e.g., optional header, image/media area, content body, action footer).
- **Spacing:** Consistent margins between cards when used in a grid or list.
- **Elevation/Border:** Standardized use of shadows or borders to define card boundaries.
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Inconsistent internal padding or element arrangement within cards.
  - Varying visual styles (shadows, borders) for cards serving similar purposes.

### 6.3. Popovers & Tooltips

- **Popover Purpose:** Display richer content or actions related to a trigger element, typically on click or hover.
- **Tooltip Purpose:** Display brief, contextual information on hover or focus, clarifying an element's function.
- **Placement:** Consistent positioning relative to the trigger element (e.g., above, below, left, right, with arrow pointing to trigger). Logic for automatic repositioning if viewport space is limited.
- **Styling:** Visually distinct from other UI elements, but consistent within their own category.
- **Dismissal (Popovers):** Clear dismissal methods (e.g., clicking outside, ESC key, explicit close button).
- **Anti-Patterns:**
  - Popovers that are difficult to trigger or dismiss.
  - Inconsistent arrow placement or styling.
  - Tooltips containing too much information or interactive elements (use a popover instead).

## 7. Responsive Design Adaptations

Layouts must adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.

### 7.1. Breakpoints

- Define a standard set of breakpoints (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop, large desktop).
- Base breakpoints on content flow rather than specific device widths where possible.
- **Example Breakpoints:**
  - `sm:` 640px
  - `md:` 768px
  - `lg:` 1024px
  - `xl:` 1280px
  - `2xl:` 1536px

### 7.2. Adaptation Strategies

- **Fluid Grids:** Columns and elements resize proportionally.
- **Stacking:** Multi-column layouts stack vertically on smaller screens.
- **Content Prioritization:** Show essential content first; less critical content might be hidden behind "show more" toggles or moved to different locations on smaller screens.
- **Navigation Transformation:**
  - Top navigation may collapse into a hamburger menu.
  - Sidebar navigation might become an off-canvas drawer.
- **Touch Target Sizes:** Ensure interactive elements are large enough for touch interaction on mobile devices (e.g., min 44x44px).
- **Spacing Adjustments:** Spacing scale might be adjusted (e.g., reduced padding/margins) on smaller screens, but still proportionally based on the defined scale.

### 7.3. Testing

- Test layouts rigorously across all defined breakpoints and on various devices/emulators.
- Consider both portrait and landscape orientations.

### 7.4. Anti-Patterns

- Content overflowing or becoming unreadable at certain breakpoints.
- Navigation patterns that are intuitive on desktop but cumbersome on mobile.
- Touch targets that are too small or too close together.
- Significant layout shifts that disorient the user when resizing or changing orientation.

## 8. Enforcement and Governance

- **Documentation:** These guidelines should be part of a living design system, easily accessible to designers and developers.
- **Component Library:** Implement these layout rules within a reusable UI component library.
- **Design Tools:** Utilize features in design tools (e.g., styles, components, auto-layout) to enforce consistency.
- **Code Reviews:** Include layout consistency checks in design and code review processes.
- **Training:** Regularly train team members on these guidelines.
- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a process for feedback and updates to the guidelines as the product evolves.

## 9. Conclusion

By adhering to these UI layout consistency guidelines, we can create a more professional, user-friendly, and efficient digital product. Consistency is not about making everything look the same, but about creating a familiar and predictable experience that empowers users.
